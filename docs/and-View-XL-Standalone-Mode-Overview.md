title: View XL Standalone Mode overview - Axon Body 4
---

The Axon Body 4 camera can be connected to a laptop or computer with Axon View XL operating in Standalone Mode to allow priority upload of videos from the camera to Axon Evidence.

In Standalone Mode, Axon View XL lets users view recorded videos, add metadata to videos and upload camera videos to Axon Evidence.

Using Axon View XL in standalone mode is separate from using Axon View XL with Axon Fleet products.

The Axon Body 4 camera is connected to the laptop or computer with a USB A to USB C cable and uses the Axon View XL standalone mode. You can request a compatible cable from your Axon representative.

When connected to View XL, an Axon Body 4 camera can be charged. However, Axon recommends that you regularly place your Axon Body 4 camera in an Axon Body 4 Dock to ensure that the camera has the correct time synchronization and latest firmware updates.

### View XL updates

Axon periodically distributes updates for the Axon View XL application. When updates are available, the system automatically downloads the update and displays an Update button showing the update is ready to install. Axon recommends installing updates as soon as possible.

Click **Update** to install the updates. It might take a couple minutes to complete the installation. Axon View XL will close during the update and will automatically reboot once the update is completed.
