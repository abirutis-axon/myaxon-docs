title: Axon Body 3 Sleep mode
---

Sleep mode puts the camera in an idle state that disables recording and buffering. While in this state, automatic activation, if enabled at your agency, will not initiate camera recording.

**Note:** The ability to use Sleep Mode is enabled by agency Axon Evidence administrators on the Axon Body 3 camera settings page. Axon Body 3 cameras that are in Sleep Mode still update positions on the Axon Respond map if the [Location available when camera is recording and buffering setting is enabled](https://my.axon.com/s/article/Axon-Body-3-Camera-Location-Information). Additionally, if the [Automatic Wi-Fi Upload feature](https://my.axon.com/s/article/AB3-Automatic-Wi-Fi-Upload) is enabled, the camera will stop uploading when it enters Sleep Mode. The camera will attempt to restart Wi-Fi upload when it exits Sleep Mode.

Sleep Mode is useful for situations where camera users may need momentary privacy. The user can enter Sleep Mode from the buffering state in less than 4 seconds, as opposed to turning the camera completely off. Similarly, the camera will exit Sleep Mode and enter a buffering or recording state in less than four seconds.

The device audit trail reflects when Sleep Mode is entered and exited. While Sleep Mode can be used an alternative to completely powering down the camera during private situations, it should not be considered a replacement for powering the camera off. Certain background processes are running while the camera is in Sleep Mode and the battery will still deplete while in this mode, just at a slower rate.
