title: Camera settings return to default in dock - Axon Body 4
---

When the Axon Body 4 camera **Settings Return to Default in Dock** setting is enabled, camera settings that are adjustable by the user will return to their default value when a camera is connected to a dock. This ensures that after a user has adjusted settings for the camera during its use, it will return to its default state prior to its next use or shift. 

The ability to have user-adjustable settings return their default when docked is enabled by agency Axon Evidence administrators on the Axon Body 4 camera settings page, under the User Permissions section.

The following user-adjustable states and settings will be returned to the default value listed below if your agency has the corresponding setting(s) enabled:

**Settings**

**Camera Function**

**Default Value**

On-camera volume buttons

Volume will always default to

Low

If **Users can adjust vibration settings** is enabled, 

then camera vibrations will default to

On

If **Users can adjust indicator light settings** is enabled

the Top LED will default to

On at 15% brightness

If **Front light** is enabled for pre-event buffering and/or recording, and **Users can adjust indicator light settings** is enabled

the Front LED will default to

On at 30% brightness

If **Automatic Brightness** is enabled, and **Users can adjust indicator light settings** is enabled

Top and Front LED Auto Brightness will default to

On

If **Users can use stealth mode** is enabled

then Stealth Mode will default to

Off

If **Users can use sleep mode** is enabled

then Sleep Mode will default to

Off

The **Settings Return to Default in Dock** functionality only affects the user-adjustable (User Permission) camera states listed in the table above. Agency-wide settings are not affected or changed with the use of this functionality.

If your agency has disabled an agency-wide setting, it remains disabled. For example, if your agency has the **Front Light** settings disabled agency-wide, the front light will remain disabled and off at all times. The default value of 30% would only be applied if your agency has the **Front Light** setting enabled and allows for end-users to adjust the front light.

Any User Permissions that your agency has enabled are still adjustable by the camera user after the default values have been synced upon docking. For example, if a user docks their camera at the end of a shift and then adjusts various user permissions using the Device Page before the start of their next shift, those user permissions will be synced to the camera and override the defaults. Similarly, upon undocking, all User Permissions enabled by the agency are adjustable by the user during their shift.
