title: Dock registration - Axon Body 4
---

Registration and configuration of Axon Body 4 Docks is not required, but registering does make inventory management of your docks, including returns through Axon Evidence, much easier. Your dock must be registered to use the Device Profile page in Axon Evidence.

Axon recommends the following best practices:

*   Use [Axon Device Manager](https://my.axon.com/s/axon-device-manager) (ADM) to register and name Axon Body 4 Docks for inventory and management purposes.
*   When using the ADM Tap Device option to look for the NFC tag, hold your mobile device near the ![User-added image](https://axon.file.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Do000000ZNME&feoid=00Nf3000003DI8R&refid=0EMDo000001fbns) icon on the dock. For the 1-bay dock, the icon is on the side of the dock nearest to the ethernet port. For the 8-bay dock, the icon is near bay 1, on the side of the dock near the power connection.
*   Use logical names when changing the Device Name in Axon Evidence. That will assist in understanding the location and purpose for the Axon Body 4 Docks.
*   Use the [Device Home](https://my.axon.com/s/article/Device-Home) feature in Axon Evidence if you have more than one location with Axon Body 4 Docks.
