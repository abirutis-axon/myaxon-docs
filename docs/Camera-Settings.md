The agency-wide settings for Axon Body 4 cameras are controlled in Axon Evidence. The settings can be adjusted by Axon Evidence administrators.

See the Axon Body 4 section of the [Axon Body Camera Settings](https://my.axon.com/s/article/Body-Camera-Settings) article for more information about the agency-wide settings.

If allowed by the agency-wide settings, some individual camera settings (mute recording, indicator lights, vibration settings, and enter/exit stealth mode) can be adjusted by Axon Body 4 camera users. See the Axon Body 4 User Manual for more information about individual camera settings and operations.
