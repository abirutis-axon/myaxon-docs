title: Dock installation - Axon Body 4
---

Before installing an 8-bay dock, Axon recommends you determine if the dock will be mounted on a desktop or on a wall mounting. 1-bay docks can be placed on a desktop or shelf as needed.

If you do not have an Axon Evidence account, Axon recommends that you contact your Axon administrator and ask for an account invitation. When the email invitation arrives, accept the invitation and create an account. This email invitation will come from noreply@evidence.com.

1.  Remove the dock from the box and confirm that all pieces are present.
2.  Plug the ethernet cable into the WAN port.

6.  Connect the other end of the power cord to a standard power outlet.  
    For 8-bay docks, the green power LED on top of the dock will light up when the dock is powered. For 1-bay docks, check for power by placing an Axon Body 4 camera in the dock and looking for the charging icon on the camera display.  
    The dock is ready to be used to register and charge Axon Body 4 cameras.  
    Once a dock is installed, it can be registered. Registering your dock is an optional, but highly recommended, step. For details, see [Axon Body 4 Dock Registration](https://my.axon.com/s/article/Axon-Body-4-Dock-Registration).
