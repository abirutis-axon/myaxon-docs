title: Axon Body 3 false signal dismissal
---

The False Signal Dismissal workflow allows an Axon Body 3 camera user to report a Signal event and the associated recording as a false detection. There is also an option to automatically add a Category to the false detection recording. 

To enable the new False Signal Dismissal workflow, both the **Signal** and **False Signal Cancellation** settings must be enabled on the Axon Body 3 Camera Settings page. By default, the **False Signal Cancellation** setting is disabled. Optionally, you can select evidence category that is automatically applied to recordings cancelled as a false activation.

### Dismissing a False Signal Event

Users can dismiss a false signal activation with a one-time press of the Select button.

**If the camera is in the READY (buffering) mode and a signal event occurs:**

**Note:** The False Signal Dismissal workflow does not allow a user to dismiss a Signal event during a recording activated prior to the Signal event.

**Note:** A user should not take it upon themselves to determine whether Signal activations are "false" when interacting with members of the community. Rather, this feature should be used in scenarios that do not involve such interactions, such as when Signal testing is occurring or when it is known that activations are false.

*   The camera begins recording. The camera display shows the message **Press Select to Cancel** for 10 seconds to allow the user to dismiss the signal activation.

*   If the Select button is pressed, the signal activation will be reported false (dismissed) and the camera will end the recording and return to the READY state.

*   If the Select button is not pressed within 10 seconds, the message is removed, the signal activation is not dismissed, and the camera will continue recording. The Signal icon is shown on the camera display.
