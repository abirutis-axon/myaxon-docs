LED Auto Brightness
===================

The LED Auto Brightness feature automatically adjusts the brightness of the camera’s front and top LED lights based on ambient light conditions.

Agency Axon Evidence administrators can enable the Automatic Brightness setting in the Lights section on the Axon Body 4 Settings page.

**Note:** Users must have permission to adjust indicator lights to enable Auto Brightness mode from the camera or Axon applications.

Once the feature is enabled, users can enter Auto Brightness mode from the [Axon Body 4 camera](#h_01ERDR50305FY3YDKW83GE0RXS), the [Axon View mobile application](#h_01ERDR591PFAMG4GQPHVAY3J7R), and the [Axon Evidence Device Detail page](#h_01ERDR5K0F21G84PBCPJWF90CQ).

When the LED Auto Brightness feature is enabled, camera users can cycle between three camera LED light options: Lights Auto, Lights Dim, and Lights Off.

    In this mode the camera LED lights will automatically adjust based on the ambient lighting condition. If the lighting conditions are bright, the LED lights will increase in brightness. If the lighting conditions are low or dark, the LED lights will become dimmer and turn off in dark situations.
