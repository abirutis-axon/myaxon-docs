---

Following are possible Axon Body 3 camera/Axon View issues.

### I get a Bonding (iOS) or Unable to Connect (Android) error message on Axon View

This error is caused by an expired access token or a time synchronization mismatch.

Follow the steps below to correct the problem:

1.  Within Axon View, go to Settings and select **Forget Current Camera**.
2.  If you are currently signed in, select **Log Out**.
3.  Navigate back to the main page and select **Initiate Pairing**.
4.  Enter your credentials and pair the camera with Axon View.
5.  If the issue persists, place your camera in a Dock for approximately 3 minutes and then repeat these steps.

You may see this error reoccur approximately every 10 days. If you see this issue again, repeat the above steps to reset access.
